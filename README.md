# Course description

The basic principles and methods of [data
science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) will be presented.
A central theme is the assessment of scientific claims, and subsequent
data collection, transformation, quantitative analysis, and reporting of
scientific results. Specific topics include for example data wrangling,
visualization, and modeling.

# Objectives

- Gain basic principles of data science
- Gain basic competence in learning to think critically about data and
  models
- Learn to do basic scientific reporting in R, RMarkdown
- Learn basic data manipulation and statistical modeling
- Conduct a scientific data practical

# Evaluation

Continuous assessment with data science exercises (graded). Work not
submitted by the required deadline will result in a fail for that given
assessment.

- Completion of all homework assignment in
  [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) (pass/fail)
- Presentation of material in the weekly reading / data practical (30%)
- [Data practical](data_practicals/README.md) (70%)

Graduate students will have additional readings and an in-class
presentation.

**Grade scale**: The grade scale will be as follows: A+, 99-100; A,
93-98; A-, 90-92; B+, 87-89; B, 83-86; B-, 80- 82; C+, 77-79; C, 73-76;
C-, 70-72; D+, 67-69; D, 63-66; F, 0-62. Standard rounding protocols
will be used, in that values \>0.5% will be rounded up.

An important note about the chapters in this class. We aim to provide a
lot of information on each topic – sometimes much more than you will
have time to read or go through, for example, multiple different
readings and tutorials on the same topic. This often appears in bullet
points where we give multiple resources on the same topic.

This highlights an important learning point of this course:

**Read what you need**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A note on learning how to code. If you have no experience, it will
likely be a steep learning curve. Search engines are your friend. If you
encounter an error, try searching on that error by copying and pasting
it into search. Almost always, someone else has already encountered and
solved your problem!

Please don’t struggle for hours on the same problem! Reach out if
needed. For example, [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) is a
popular place for coding questions. You can also ask your instructor in
class or via email.

**But in any case make sure you provide a reproducible example!** For
example:

- <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html>
- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example>

The code and the data are needed to reproduce the error or issue

Lastly, every classroom has students with different levels of
experience. The goal is that you understand and can implement the
learning objectives in this course. It is not the goal that you go
through every single URL provided in each lecture in detail. But of
course read what interests you!

**Good luck and have fun!!!**

# Other information

**Respectful participation and conduct**: Open and mutually respectful
communication of varied opinions, beliefs, and perspectives encourages
the free exchange of ideas that is essential to higher learning. We
welcome debate and critical arguments but do not tolerate harassment or
discrimination. Conduct that is disrespectful can result in dismissal
from the course. For example, there is zero tolerance for comments that
are racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, or that
demonstrate other forms of discriminatory language.

**Academic Integrity**: The University of Miami Honor Code applies to
all students. Violations of this policy include all forms of scholastic
dishonesty, such as plagiarism, cheating on an examination, copying or
collaborating on assignments without permission, fabrication or
falsification of data or records, and other forms of deceit, dishonesty,
or inappropriate conduct. Violations of academic integrity for any
assignment may result in no credit being received for that assignment.
As a serious ethical and legal violation, it can further result in
failure of the course and possible dismissal from UM. Please see the
detailed Honor Code for further information:

**Disability Services**: Students wishing to request services or
accommodations should register and provide appropriate documentation to
the Office of Disability Services, reachable at 305-284-2374. More
information is available at
<https://camnercenter.miami.edu/disability-services/accessibility/index.html>.
Please inform me of any accommodations you require.

**Mental health**: The University of Miami Counseling Center provides a
range of resources to help students resolve personal and interpersonal
difficulties. These include, for example, concerns about academics,
feelings of anxiety and depression, conflicts with or worry about
friends or family, concerns about eating or drinking patterns, and other
challenges. Please visit <https://counseling.studentaffairs.miami.edu/>
to explore available resources; or call 305-284-5511 or stop by the
Counseling Center to make an appointment. If you need someone to talk to
after normal business hours, call 305-284-5511.

**Bias reporting**: The University has a process through which students,
faculty, staff, and community members who have experienced or witnessed
incidents of bias, prejudice, or discrimination can report their
experiences. A bias incident may take the form of a verbal interaction,
cyber-interaction, physical interaction, or interaction with property.

discrimination prohibited by state and federal laws, including Title IX
and Title VII, and in keeping with the University’s values and policies.
All members of the UM community are bound by the Sexual Misconduct
Policy, which can be accessed under the “Policies and Procedures”” tab

If you need help, there are multiple options open to you. Please visit  
<https://titleix.miami.edu/_assets/pdf/gethelp.pdf> to find out where
you can seek medical attention, talk to someone confidentially, learn
about your reporting options, and seek protective measures. For an
emergency, call 911. For immediate, non-emergency help, you can call the
University’s 24-hour Sexual Assault ResourceTeam at 305-798-6666.

If a student comes to me to discuss or disclose an instance of sexual
assault, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, dating violence,
domestic violence or stalking, or if I observe or becomes aware of such
an allegation, I will keep the information as private as I can, but I am
required to immediately report it to the University’s Title IX Office.

The University is committed to offering reasonable academic
accommodations to students who are victims of sexual assault. Depending
on the specific nature of the situation, such measures may include but
are not limited to: implementation of a no-contact order,
course/classroom assignment changes, and other academic support services
and accommodations. See
<http://itsonus.miami.edu/get-help/seek-protective-measures/index.html>
for more information. To request protective measures, you may contact
the Dean of Students Office at 305-284-5353 or <doso@miami.edu>
